This chrome extension was named "ILGRL", which stands for I Like Google
Rather Links. When web users clicked a link, the users expected that the
new articles are appeared. However, some links are directed to
intermediate websites. In this case, the user needs to seek content and
then click the link. This chrome extension uses google search rather
than URL navigation by links. The reason is simple - I like google
rather links.
